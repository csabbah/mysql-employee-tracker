## Description

This node application allows users to perform CRUD operations on a dedicated MySQL (Sqlite3) database. Users can add, delete, update and view specific pieces of data. Depending on chain of commands, users can also sort the data they are viewing by specific values, view data by departments and or managers, view the total utilization of budget per department and so on. Everything runs in the local command line using the Node.js inquirer module and many complex conditionals that ensure the best possible and consistent results.
